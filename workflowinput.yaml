workflowdescription: ms2query workflow to execute MS2query
workflowlongdescription: MS2Query uses MS2 mass spectra to find the best match in a library and is able to search for both analogues and exact matches. A pretrained library for MS2Query is available based on the GNPS library.   More information about the method can be found in the paper https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37446-4 or on the GitHub https://github.com/iomega/ms2query.
